# Temtris
Temtris is basically a Tetris clone we made as our project for CSCI 352. Tetris is a game where 4 block section shapes fall from top down and you try to fit rows of these blocks together at an ever increasing pace until the screen inevitably fills causing game over. A score is computed based on how efficiently you clear the board as the game progresses, with more points being awarded for streaks of row clears and tetris row clears (4 simultaneous row clears).
